### Manual installation

To manually install this app to [IBM Bluemix](https://www.bluemix.net) via the command line you will need either the `bluemix` or `cf` command line tool. The instructions for installing this can be found at [http://clis.ng.bluemix.net/ui/home.html] and [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases] respectively.

Once you have these tools, you will need to assign a [IBM Bluemix](https://www.bluemix.net) API to the tool. The command is:

`cf api <api url>`

The available API URLs currently are `https://api.ng.bluemix.net` (US), `https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net` (UK) and `https://api.au-syd.bluemix.net` (AUS). Once you have assigned an API endpoint you will need to login via

`cf login`

Once that's done we can actually deploy the app. First you will need to grab your own copy.

```
git clone git@github.com:ibm-cds-labs/wordpress-on-bluemix.git
cd ghost-on-bluemix
```

You will also need to create the instance of @Compose for MySQL using the command:

`cf create-service compose-for-mysql Standard WordpressDatabase`

Once the instance is created all you need to do is deploy the code to [IBM Bluemix](https://www.bluemix.net) with the command:

`cf push`

Now you have a working version of Wordpress running on [IBM Bluemix](https://www.bluemix.net).

## Setting up your administrator

Once you have a working version of Wordpress you will need to finish setting up everything. You will need to go to your application on [IBM Bluemix](https://www.bluemix.net) and fill in the initial setup.
